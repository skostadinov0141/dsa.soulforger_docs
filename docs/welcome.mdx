## What is this?
This is the official documentation for **Project Soulforger**. The documentation is written in 
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and is hosted on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and is primairly meant to
be read by developers.

## What is Soulforger?
Soulforger is a digital platform acting as a hub for multiple pen and paper based roleplaying games. The goal of Soulforger is to 
provide a platform for players and game masters to play their games online. The platform will provide tools to help with the 
organization of games, the creation of characters and the management of the game itself. The platform will also provide a way for
players to find new games and for game masters to find new players.

## What is the goal of this documentation?
Due to the Open Source nature of the project, I want to provide a way for developers to easily contribute to the project. This
documentation will provide a way for developers to get started with the project and to get a better understanding of the project
itself.
